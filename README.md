#AWS user learning about rabbitmq 

The RabbitMQ is a messaging broker like SQS in AWS.

I think is normal try to do a 1:1 comparsion betwen the services, so lets try to do that.

The first concept I consider important to learn about the rabbitMQ is the "Exchange".

Using a direct comparsion "Exchanges" can be used like a SNS

In the follow image we can see how the "exchange" works in RabbitMQ.
